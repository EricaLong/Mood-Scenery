# 🏞️ Mood Scenery
A sensory "Oracle" that transforms human emotion into immersive digital atmospheres. Type a mood or pick one—background videos from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com) update to match.

### 📋 **Project Overview** 

Traditional interfaces are often static and emotionally indifferent. This project explores Emotional UI (EUI)—an interface that adapts its visual language, motion, and content based on the user's psychological state. By typing a simple mood, the user triggers a global state change that orchestrates high-resolution imagery, ambient CSS animations, and curated philosophical quotes into a unified "vibe."

### **🧠 The "Vibe Coding" Workflow**

As a Senior Product Designer, I acted as the Creative Director and Architect for this mini project. Using Claude Code + Opus 4.6, I translated my Figma logic into a functional prototype:

Logic Mapping: Defined the "State Machine" transitions (scale, blur, and position) to ensure spatial consistency.

API Orchestration: Directed the integration of the Pexels API to ensure dynamic, high-quality video backgrounds that match the user's mood.

Iterative Refinement: Used natural language to fine-tune micro-interactions, such as the 1.5s ease-in-out transitions and the "tilt" hover effects on UI elements.

### **🛠️ Key Features & Interaction Design**

State-Aware Glassmorphism: A functional use of "Frosted Glass" that blurs the background to prioritize text legibility during input, then clears to reveal the scenery upon submission.

Contextual Ambient Layers: Beyond static images, the UI generates "top-layer" effects—such as falling rain particles or golden-hour light leaks—to deepen the sensory immersion.

Meteor-Line Progress: A custom-animated text underline that provides tactile feedback during active input states, mimicking celestial motion.

Oracle Content Strategy: Integrated logic that maps user intent to a curated database of poetic quotes, ensuring the copy resonates with the visual atmosphere.
